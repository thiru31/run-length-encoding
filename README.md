# Run-Length Encoding in C++

This C++ program implements the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm, which is a simple form of data compression where consecutive elements of the data that are the same are replaced with a single element and the count of occurrences.

Example
Suppose you enter the string "wwwwaaadexxxxxxywww" as input. The program will output:

w4a3d1e1x6y1w3
This indicates that the input string has consecutive characters "w" repeated 4 times, "a" repeated 3 times, and so on.
